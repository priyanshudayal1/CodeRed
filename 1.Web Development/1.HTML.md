# CodeRed Workshop - Complete HTML

## Introduction

- **HTML** : Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

- **HTML Elements** : An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the `<p>` element, would be written as `<p> This is a paragraph </p>`.

- **HTML Tags** : HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets like `<html>`. HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<h1>` and `</h1>`. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag. The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.

- **HTML Attributes** : HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
