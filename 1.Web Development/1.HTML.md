# CodeRed Workshop - Complete HTML

## Introduction to Web Development
- **Web Development** is the process of building and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.

- **Frontend Development** is the practice of producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.

- **Backend Development** is the server-side of web development. It includes everything that happens on the server-side like databases, servers, etc.

- **Full Stack Development** is the combination of both frontend and backend development. A full-stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front and back ends of a website or application.

- **Database Management** is the process of managing data stored in a computer. It involves the collection, storage, and retrieval of data.

- **MERN Stack** is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used to develop web applications. MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

- **MEAN Stack** is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used to develop web applications. MEAN is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.

- **Web Development Tools** : There are many tools available for web development. Some of the most popular tools are:
  - **Code Editors** : Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.
  - **Version Control** : Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.
  - **Web Browsers** : Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.
  - **Web Development Frameworks** : React, Angular, Vue, etc.

## Introduction to HTML

- **HTML** : Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

- **HTML Elements** : An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the `<p>` element, would be written as `<p> This is a paragraph </p>`.

- **HTML Tags** : HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets like `<html>`. HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<h1>` and `</h1>`. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag. The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.

- **HTML Attributes** : HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

## Boilerplate Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
        
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
``` 

- **<!DOCTYPE html>** : The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines this document to be HTML5.

- **<html>** : The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.

- **<head>** : The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML document.

- **<title>** : The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML document.

- **<body>** : The `<body>` element contains the visible page content.


- **HTML elements** are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML elements, you can define the structure of your content.

- **HTML Tags** : HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets like `<html>`. HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<h1>` and `</h1>`. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag. The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.


## Basic HTML Tags

- **<h1> to <h6>** : The `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements define HTML headings.

- **<p>** : The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

- **<a>** : The `<a>` element defines a hyperlink.

- **<img>** : The `<img>` element defines an image.


## Lists in HTML

- **Unordered List** : An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.
```html
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
```

- **Ordered List** : An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.
```html
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
```

## Typography in HTML

- **<b>** : The `<b>` element specifies bold text.

- **<strong>** : The `<strong>` element specifies important text.

- **<i>** : The `<i>` element specifies italic text.

- **<em>** : The `<em>` element specifies emphasized text.

- **<mark>** : The `<mark>` element defines marked or highlighted text.

- **<small>** : The `<small>` element defines smaller text.

- **<del>** : The `<del>` element defines deleted text.

- **<u>** : The `<u>` element defines underlined text.

## Inline V/s Block Elements

- **Inline Elements** : An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. For example, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, etc.

- **Block Elements** : A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. For example, `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc.

## Div and Span Elements

- **<div>** : The `<div>` element is a block-level container used to group HTML elements. It is often used to group elements for styling purposes (using CSS).

- **<span>** : The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

## Some More HTML Elements

- The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

- The `<br>` element is used to insert a single line break.

- `<sub>` : The `<sub>` element defines subscripted text.

- `<sup>` : The `<sup>` element defines superscripted text.

## Semantic HTML

- **Semantic HTML** : Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

- **Benefits of Semantic HTML** : 
  - **Accessibility** : Semantic HTML helps screen readers and search engines to understand the content of a webpage.
  - **SEO** : Semantic HTML helps search engines to understand the content of a webpage.
  - **Readability** : Semantic HTML makes the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Examples of Semantic HTML** :
    - `<header>` : Defines a header for a document or a section.
    - `<nav>` : Defines navigation links.
    - `<main>` : Defines the main content of a document.
    - `<section>` : Defines a section in a document.
    - `<article>` : Defines an article in a document.
    - `<aside>` : Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar).
    - `<footer>` : Defines a footer for a document or a section.
